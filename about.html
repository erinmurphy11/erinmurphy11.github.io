                    Hello! <br><br>I’m Erin Murphy, a current Junior at Florida State University studying Computer Engineering.  Outside of 
                    class, I’m an athlete on FSU’s NCAA Beach Volleyball team.  I also conduct research about computer vision and 
                    synthetic data under Dr. Jonathan Adams and our newly founded research center the MLab! 
                    <br> <br> I ultimately plan on adding a blog page to share more about these experiences and projects.  For now, 
                    this site is more of an extended resume! <br><br>
                    Feel free to reach out with any questions 😊
