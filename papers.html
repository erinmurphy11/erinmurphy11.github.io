            <p>Developed a synthetic visual data production method and used the resulting synthetic imagery to train a 
                YOLOv3 classification model.  The model identifies various species of sea turtles. Synthetic images were rendered and augmented 
                via Blender’s bpy library and Python interface, and stored in the team’s SynthBlend repository. YOLOv3 was then trained 
                on multiple ratios of authentic and synthetic visual data to test which ratio of data produced the most confident model. 
                Optimizing the classification model and demonstrated significant accuracy improvements, especially with 
                models trained without authentic data. The fully synthetic dataset performed best in testing, with an average 
                confidence level of 9.68 percent greater than the fully authentic dataset.</p>

            <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9419586" target="_blank">Assessing the Qualities of Synthetic Visual Data Production</a>
            <p> Conducted a literature review on emerging research practices and applications of synthetic visual data over the past 5 
                years. The current research examines articles related to research trends in artificial intelligence training intended to 
                improve computer vision and object detection. 
                Search strings were developed and used to retrieve research articles from the ACM and IEEE databases.
                The resulting articles were reviewed for trends, general practices, disciplines where the greatest efforts have
                been made, advances, and relevant production processes. The research reveals that visual synthetic data
                encompasses filtering, augmentation and object domain randomization techniques. Research evaluating
                synthetic visual data suggests that there are noteworthy performance improvements and reductions in limitations such 
                as labeling, image quality, paucity of relevant data, and privacy issues. </p>

            <a href="https://www.learntechlib.org/p/215929/" target="_blank">AI and Undergraduate Research: A Dialog in Project-Based Learning</a>
            <p>Explored the use of artificial intelligence as a teaching tool. The research team determined that
               an artificial intelligence project-based learning task can effectively be used to introduce undergraduate computer 
               science students to machine learning and its associated work pipeline. This pipeline includes collecting data, labeling data, and 
               then training an algorithm on the labeled data. There is a lack of current knowledge discussing the best 
               practices for approaching the machine learning task pipeline, subsequently, the research team discovered that certain 
               aspects of the pipeline, such as data verification, can take up a large portion of the workload. </p>
